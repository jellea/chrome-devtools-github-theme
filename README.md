#Github Theme for Chrome Developer tools [Elements and Console]

Sometime ago I fell in love with Github's colorscheme. As a colourblind
person choices in colorschemes are very limited, few have the contrast
I'm able to percieve. Github's colorscheme has. I don't know if they did
it on purpose but it's great. There's a great port for
[vim](https://github.com/endel/vim-github-colorscheme), for example. Chrome's dev tools syntax colors are horrible for me to percieve and
thus I ported the Github theme to Chrome's dev tools.
